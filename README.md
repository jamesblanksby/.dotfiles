# 💻 .dotfiles

A collection of bootstrap dotfiles and personalised macOS/Linux defaults.

These are **my** personalised defaults – please review the code accordingly before installing.

## Usage

### ⚡️ Install

⚠️ **Use with caution** ⚠️

The bootstrap script will copy the latest version into your home directory overwriting any existing files in the process.

Run the following to install on your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesblanksby/.dotfiles.git && cd .dotfiles && ./bootstrap
```

### 💎 Update

To update, `cd` into your local `.dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
git pull && ./bootstrap
```

### 🍎 macOS defaults

Set personalised defaults, run the following:

```bash
./macos
```
